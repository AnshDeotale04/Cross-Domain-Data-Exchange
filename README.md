# Cross-Domain-Data-Exchange
CDDX will enable the transfer of data from one database cluster to another database cluster of different jurisdiction to share that data while maintaining the ownership of data to the parent cluster and remove the data from another cluster as soon as the work is done. This is done with the help of a central registry which hold location of all data.
